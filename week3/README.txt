Information about the distance coloring point:
Filled 2D vector array with 0's.
Simply followed the pseudo code provided with slight variations on current_Z vaue.
Coloring based off the z value multiplied by (255/2) due to edits I made to curent_Z.
Mode 2 simply checked for alpha, beta, gamma to be between 0 and 0.05.
Overall, pretty much everything was provided in lecture's pseudo code with only .
Coloring for reds increasing with greater Z distance.

Plus anything else of note:
C++ is ugly. The hardest part of this Project was understanding the weird vectors and syntax of C++.
